## The Many Strains of Anti-vax: A study of COVID-19 anti-vaccination Tweets 
Project type: natural language processing (NLP)

- Used NMF topic modeling to identify topics within the Twitter COVID-19 anti-vaccine movement 
- Reconstituted a collection of > 300K Tweets containing anti-vaccine keywords
- Identified 9 topics, which can be organized into 3 broader categories: anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and a mix of both 
  - (Many pro-vaccine Tweets made it into the dataset, even though data collection was designed to catch only anti-vaccine topics)
