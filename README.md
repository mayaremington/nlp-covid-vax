## The Many Strains of Anti-vaxxers: A study of COVID-19 anti-vaccination Tweets 
Project type: natural language processing (NLP)

- Used NMF topic modeling to identify sub-topics within the Twitter COVID-19 anti-vaccine movement 
- Reconstituted a collection of Tweets containing anti-vaccine keywords
- Identified 9 sub-topics, which can be organized into 3 broader categories: anti-vaccine, pro-vaccine, and a mix of both. (Although data collection was designed to catch anti-vaccine Tweets, many pro-vaccine Tweets made it through!)
